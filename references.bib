    ABSTRACT = {In recent years, technological advances have led to the
        increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for forestry
            applications. One emerging field for drone application is forest
            health monitoring (FHM). Common approaches for FHM involve
            small-scale resource-extensive fieldwork combined with traditional
            remote sensing platforms. However, the highly dynamic nature of
            forests requires timely and repetitive data acquisition, often at
            very high spatial resolution, where conventional remote sensing
            techniques reach the limits of feasibility. UAVs have shown that
            they can meet the demands of flexible operation and high spatial
            resolution. This is also reflected in a rapidly growing number of
            publications using drones to study forest health. Only a few
            reviews exist which do not cover the whole research history of
            UAV-based FHM. Since a comprehensive review is becoming critical to
            identify research gaps, trends, and drawbacks, we offer a
            systematic analysis of 99 papers covering the last ten years of
            research related to UAV-based monitoring of forests threatened by
            biotic and abiotic stressors. Advances in drone technology are
            being rapidly adopted and put into practice, further improving the
            economical use of UAVs. Despite the many advantages of UAVs, such
            as their flexibility, relatively low costs, and the possibility to
            fly below cloud cover, we also identified some shortcomings: (1)
            multitemporal and long-term monitoring of forests is clearly
            underrepresented; (2) the rare use of hyperspectral and LiDAR
            sensors must drastically increase; (3) complementary data from
            other RS sources are not sufficiently being exploited; (4) a lack
            of standardized workflows poses a problem to ensure data
            uniformity; (5) complex machine learning algorithms and workflows
            obscure interpretability and hinders widespread adoption; (6) the
            data pipeline from acquisition to final analysis often relies on
            commercial software at the expense of open-source tools.},

    ABSTRACT = {Urban trees and forests provide multiple ecosystem services
        (ES), including temperature regulation, carbon sequestration, and
            biodiversity. Interest in ES has increased amongst policymakers,
        scientists, and citizens given the extent and growth of urbanized areas
            globally. However, the methods and techniques used to properly
            assess biodiversity and ES provided by vegetation in urban
            environments, at large scales, are insufficient. Individual tree
            identification and characterization are some of the most critical
            issues used to evaluate urban biodiversity and ES, given the
            complex spatial distribution of vegetation in urban areas and the
            scarcity or complete lack of systematized urban tree inventories at
            large scales, e.g., at the regional or national levels. This often
            limits our knowledge on their contributions toward shaping
            biodiversity and ES in urban areas worldwide. This paper provides
            an analysis of the state-of-the-art studies and was carried out
            based on a systematic review of 48 scientific papers published
            during the last five years (2016–2020), related to urban tree and
            greenery characterization, remote sensing techniques for tree
            identification, processing methods, and data analysis to classify
            and segment trees. In particular, we focused on urban tree and
            forest characterization using remotely sensed data and identified
            frontiers in scientific knowledge that may be expanded with new
            developments in the near future. We found advantages and
            limitations associated with both data sources and processing
            methods, from which we drew recommendations for further development
            of tree inventory and characterization in urban forestry science.
            Finally, a critical discussion on the current state of the methods,
        as well as on the challenges and directions for future research, is
            presented.},

Historically, such information was often acquired through manual interpretation of aerial photographs. As traditional methods of analyzing aerial photographs can be time-consuming, subjective, and can require well-trained interpreters (who are currently in short supply), new approaches must be explored for collecting this ecological information. First, we discuss the benefits and challenges of using aerial photographs for ecological management. We then examine the eight fundamental characteristics used in photograph interpretation and discuss their ecological relevance. Third, we investigate the feasibility of digital-analysis methods (often used for analysis of satellite imagery) for providing more objective, consistent, and cost-effective results. We end with several examples of how the unique information from aerial photographs can aid in solutions to emerging challenges in ecological research and management, and how they may be further used with supplementary data sets.},

ABSTRACT = {Remote sensing is a useful tool for monitoring spatio-temporal variations of crop morphological and physiological status and supporting practices in precision farming. In comparison with multispectral imaging, hyperspectral imaging is a more advanced technique that is capable of acquiring a detailed spectral response of target features. Due to limited accessibility outside of the scientific community, hyperspectral images have not been widely used in precision agriculture. In recent years, different mini-sized and low-cost airborne hyperspectral sensors (e.g., Headwall Micro-Hyperspec, Cubert UHD 185-Firefly) have been developed, and advanced spaceborne hyperspectral sensors have also been or will be launched (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS, EnMAP, HyspIRI). Hyperspectral imaging is becoming more widely available to agricultural applications. Meanwhile, the acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery still remain a challenging research topic (e.g., large data volume, high data dimensionality, and complex information analysis). It is hence beneficial to conduct a thorough and in-depth review of the hyperspectral imaging technology (e.g., different platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing hyperspectral information, and recent advances of hyperspectral imaging in agricultural applications. Publications over the past 30 years in hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in agriculture were thus reviewed. The imaging platforms and sensors, together with analytic methods used in the literature, were discussed. Performances of hyperspectral imaging for different applications (e.g., crop biophysical and biochemical properties’ mapping, soil characteristics, and crop classification) were also evaluated. This review is intended to assist agricultural researchers and practitioners to better understand the strengths and limitations of hyperspectral imaging to agricultural applications and promote the adoption of this valuable technology. Recommendations for future hyperspectral imaging research for precision agriculture are also presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Plants serve as the basis for ecosystems and provide a wide range of essential ecological, environmental, and economic benefits. However, forest plants and other forest systems are constantly threatened by degradation and extinction, mainly due to misuse and exhaustion. Therefore, sustainable forest management (SFM) is paramount, especially in the wake of global climate change and other challenges. SFM ensures the continued provision of plants and forests to both the present and future generations. In practice, SFM faces challenges in balancing the use and conservation of forests. This review discusses the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning (DL) technologies in sustainable forest management. It summarizes current research and technological improvements implemented in sustainable forest management using AI, discussing their applications, such as predictive analytics and modeling techniques that enable accurate forecasting of forest dynamics in carbon sequestration, species distribution, and ecosystem conditions. Additionally, it explores how AI-powered decision support systems facilitate forest adaptive management strategies by integrating real-time data in the form of images or videos. The review manuscript also highlights limitations incurred by AI, ML, and DL in combating challenges in sustainable forest management, providing acceptable solutions to these problems. It concludes by providing future perspectives and the immense potential of AI, ML, and DL in modernizing SFM. Nonetheless, a great deal of research has already shed much light on this topic, this review bridges the knowledge gap.},

ABSTRACT = {A compact solution for the accurate and automated collection of field data in forests has long been anticipated, and tremendous efforts have been made by applying various remote sensing technologies. The employment of advanced techniques, such as the smartphone-based relascope, terrestrial and mobile photogrammetry, and laser scanning, have led to steady progress, thus steering their applications to a practical stage. However, all recent strategies require human operation for data acquisition, either to place the instrument on site (e.g., terrestrial laser scanning, TLS) or to carry the instrument by an operator (e.g., personal laser scanning, PLS), which remained laborious and expensive. In this paper, a new concept of autonomous forest field investigation is proposed, which includes data collection above and inside the forest canopy by integrating an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) with autonomous driving. As a first step towards realizing this concept, the feasibility of automated tree-level field measurements from a mini-UAV laser scanning system is evaluated. A “low-cost” Velodyne Puck LITE laser scanner is applied for the test. It is revealed that, with the above canopy flight data, the detection rate was 100\% for isolated and dominant trees. The accuracy of direct measurements on the diameter at breast height (DBH) from the point cloud is between 5.5 and 6.8 cm due to the system and the methodological error propagation. The estimation of DBH from point cloud metrics, on the other hand, showed an accuracy of 2.6 cm, which is comparable to the accuracies obtained with terrestrial surveys using mobile laser scanning (MLS), TLS or photogrammetric point clouds. The estimation of basal area, stem volume and biomass of individual trees could be obtained with less than 20\% RMSE, which is adequate for field reference measurements at tree level. Such results indicate that the concept of UAV laser scanning-based automated tree-level field reference collection can be feasible, even though the whole topic requires further research.},

abstract = {Abstract Climate change induces multiple abiotic and biotic risks to forests and forestry. Risks in different spatial and temporal scales must be considered to ensure preconditions for sustainable multifunctional management of forests for different ecosystem services. For this purpose, the present review article summarizes the most recent findings on major abiotic and biotic risks to boreal forests in Finland under the current and changing climate, with the focus on windstorms, heavy snow loading, drought and forest fires and major insect pests and pathogens of trees. In general, the forest growth is projected to increase mainly in northern Finland. In the south, the growing conditions may become suboptimal, particularly for Norway spruce. Although the wind climate does not change remarkably, wind damage risk will increase especially in the south, because of the shortening of the soil frost period. The risk of snow damage is anticipated to increase in the north and decrease in the south. Increasing drought in summer will boost the risk of large-scale forest fires. Also, the warmer climate increases the risk of bark beetle outbreaks and the wood decay by Heterobasidion root rot in coniferous forests. The probability of detrimental cascading events, such as those caused by a large-scale wind damage followed by a widespread bark beetle outbreak, will increase remarkably in the future. Therefore, the simultaneous consideration of the biotic and abiotic risks is essential.},
